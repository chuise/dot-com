For the longest time this website has been a picture of my face, as handsome as it is, and a few links to some places around the web where I post things. Not very interesting. At least not to me. I've always wanted it to be so much more. Way back in the day I tried an experiment where I would challenge myself to take a photo or draw something and pair it with some bit of text once a day. It forced me to stretch a bit. Sun salutations for creativity, perhaps.

But these days, who has the time?

I'm a father of two, husband to one, and design team of one at Artisan. Throw in a passion project or two for good measure. I want to dedicate time to building out a "personal brand" because everyone says it's a good thing, but it's probably better to invest that time, plus more, into being a better father and husband. I spend a lot of my time with my face buried _in_ a device when I should be more concerned about what's happening _around_ them.

That being said, I do want this site to be something. I like to build. I like to experiment. I have opinions that I like to express. I want this to be the place where I do that.

My friend Kyle recently published an article about [launching before you're ready](http://kylefiedler.com/2015/02/22/launching-incomplete.html "Read: Launch When You Aren't Ready by Kyle Fielder"). I'm not ready. I don't have a plan. There are no fonts picked out, no colors decided on, no epic design waiting in the wings. I'm starting fresh, from the ground up and I'm doing it in public.

For now, I'm going way back. No stylesheets. Just the bare essentials -- two turntables and a microphone. You want responsive? You can't get much better.

Over time I want this site to evolve into something I'm proud of, but it's going to take just that -- time. The old page is being [archived here](http://v9.chuise.com "2013 &mdash; March, 2015") for posterity. Hopefully this marks the end of an era for the "splash page" version of this site. 

As designers I feel like our personal sites are often the cobbler's children. There's work to be done -- whether it be our day jobs or side projects. Our energies are devoted to things we build for other people. We rarely get a chance to spend time on ourselves, unless we're out looking for a job and trying to boost our portfolios.

This site has been the bastard child of a weary cobbler for far too long, it's time it got a new pair of shoes -- even if they are a shitty pair of Zips.
