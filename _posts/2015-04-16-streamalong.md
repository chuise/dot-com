I love Periscope. Let's get that out of the way. Periscope has only existed a few short weeks, but I feel like it's already become part of my daily life. I broadcast from time-to-time, but I watch a lot. We'll get to that later.

Shortly after Periscope launched I was at home cooking dinner and I started thinking about possibilities of live streaming services like Periscope and Meerkat. I love cooking. Why couldn't I just start my own live cooking show and start broadcasting it? "Tune in every Wednesday at 6 PM Eastern for Cooking with Kevin", or something like that. I mean, who would actually watch "Cooking with Kevin"? You get the idea though.

The next day I was chatting with [Chris Baglieri](http://twitter.com/chrisbaglieri) about Periscope and my thoughts from the night before. Turns out he was thinking along the same lines. After chatting over lunch we came to the conclusion that Periscope is great, but finding Scopes outside of your network of friends is very difficult. Periscope recently launched the "Global" stream, which separates out the global content from that of your friends, but we wanted more.

Fast forward one week, give or take a day or two, and we proudly present [Streamalong.tv](http://streamalong.tv) -- the best way to discover content on Periscope.

There are some amazing broadcasters out there on Periscope and we've hopefully taken a step toward making it easier to find those people. I've had a lot of fun discovering broadcasts while building Streamalong. I love checking out everything from news stations giving the behind the scenes studio tours, to random AMAs, to some dude saying "Tool Time" over and over again, to TV's [Maria Menounos](https://twitter.com/mariamenounos) sharing some of her favorite music with people. My new favorite thing to do is tune in to Jay and Dan from [@foxsportslive](http://twitter.com/foxsportslive) to be a part of their "two-screen experience". I had never watched the show before I discovered their Periscope broadcasts, now I'm hooked.

I think what we have is relatively small compared to what it could be. I'm excited to see your reactions and to see if other people find what we've built useful. If you want, more talk to [@streamalongtv on Twitter](http://twitter.com/streamalongtv). We'd love to hear your thoughts.

Chris has a [post over on his blog](http://chrisbaglieri.com/blog/2015/4/15/streamalong-a-better-way-to-discover-on-periscope), too. Take minute or two to give it a read.
