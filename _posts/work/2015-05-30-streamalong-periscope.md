I like Periscope a lot. I’m not going to go into the reasons why here. I’ve already covered that [in a separate post]({% post_url 2015-04-16-streamalong %}). One my biggest gripes with Periscope is the ability to discover interesting content to watch. It turns out that I wasn’t alone. [Chris Baglieri](http://www.chrisbaglieri.com) and I set out on a mission to create the TV Guide for streaming video. With that, [Streamalong.tv](http://streamalong.tv) was born.

Our goal was to launch something fast. That didn't leave a whole lot of room for exploration on a logo. I tried a few things, but ultimately landed on a design that I had origianlly scribbled on a piece of paper earlier in the day. I knew that I wanted to form an "S" shape out of two objects to create the idea of "togetherness", which is at the core of the name. Choosing the primary color was a bit easier. I don't get a whole lot of opportunities to work with the color pink and decided now was the time.

The core idea behind Streamalong is organizing Periscope streams into easy to identify channels. The icons each follow similar pattern – simple illustrations, vibrant pallete, and a portion of the icon that extends outside of the bounding cirlce when it makes sense. The result was a fun, unique set of icons that helps give Streamalong some personality. The current fan favorite is the "Bored" channel icon.

We wanted to ensure that people browsing Streamalong on desktop and mobile devices had a similar experience. The site is fully responsive and utilizes some server-side components to help reduce the amount of information delivered to mobile devices to make sure that the pages load fast.

We built Streamalong using Rails 4. Chris handled the heavy-lifting on the backend of the site while I handled the branding, illustration, HTML and Sass – with a little help from [Bourbon](http://bourbon.io) and [Neat](http://neat.bourbon.io)... and maybe a little bit of actual bourbon.

Streamalong was a fun project that was delivered very quickly. Streamalong was conceived, designed, developed, and launched in less than two weeks. It was featured on [ProductHunt](http://producthunt.com) and ended the day as one of the top Hunts. In addtion to that, Streamalong was featured in [The Next Web](http://thenextweb.com/apps/2015/04/17/streamalong-helps-you-discover-the-best-and-worst-of-periscope/) and [Technical.ly Philly](http://technical.ly/philly/2015/04/17/streamalong-periscope-discovery-guide/).
