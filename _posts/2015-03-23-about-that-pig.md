A few days ago I hit the [self destruct button]( {% post_url 2015-03-18-self-destruction %} "Read: Self-Destruct Sequence Initiated") on this site. There wasn't much there to begin with, but I had grown tired of the site and even wearier of the thought of planning out and designing my personal site. The result was a bit ugly. That might be an [understatement](http://v10.chuise.com "Check out the reset of chuise.com").

I was a bit shocked by the reaction that I received about pulling the plug and getting back to basics. I hadn't really thought anything of it other than, "I'm tired".

Simple, honest, and personal seem like some good things to aspire to. So while I still don't have a really good idea on what this site will become I have a pretty good idea on what the guiding principles should be.

With that said, it's time to put the first coat of lipstick on this pig.
