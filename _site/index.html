    	<p>March 23, 2015</p>

		<p>A few days ago I hit the <a href="/2015/03/18/self-destruction/" title="Read: Self-Destruct Sequence Initiated">self destruct button</a> on this site. There wasn’t much there to begin with, but I had grown tired of the site and even wearier of the thought of planning out and desiging my personal site. The result was a bit ugly. That might be an understatement.</p>

<p>I was a bit shocked by the reaction that I received about pulling the plug and getting back to basics. I hadn’t really thought anything of it other than, “I’m tired”.</p>

<p>Simple, honest, and personal seem like some good things to aspire to. So while I still don’t have a really good idea on what this site will become I have a pretty good idea on what the guiding pricipals should be.</p>

<p>With that said, it’s time to put the first coat of lipstick on this pig.</p>

    	<p>March 18, 2015</p>

		<p>For the longest time this website has been a picture of my face, as handsome as it is, and a few links to some places around the web where I post things. Not very interesting. At least not to me. I’ve always wanted it to be so much more. Way back in the day I tried an experiment where I would challenge myself to take a photo or draw something and pair it with some bit of text once a day. It forced me to stretch a bit. Sun salutations for creativity, perhaps.</p>

<p>But these days… who has the time?</p>

<p>I’m a father of two, and husband to one on the home-front. I’m also a design team of one at <a href="http://useartisan.com" title="This is where I work.">Artisan</a>. Throw in a passion project or two and an energetic dog for good measure. I’m spent. I want to dedicate time to building out a “personal brand” because everyone says it’s a good thing, but it’s probably better to invest that time, plus more, into being a better father and husband. I spend a lot of my time with my face buried <em>in</em> a device when I should be more concerned about what’s happening <em>around</em> them.</p>

<p>That being said, I do want this site to be <em>something</em>. I like to build. I like to experiment. I have opinions that I like to express. I have things that I want to share with whoever is paying attention. I want this to be the place where I do that.</p>

<p>My friend Kyle recently published an article about <a href="http://kylefiedler.com/2015/02/22/launching-incomplete.html" title="Read: Launch When You Aren't Ready by Kyle Fielder">launching before you’re ready</a>. I’m not ready. I don’t have a plan. There are no fonts picked out, no colors decided on, no epic design waiting in the wings. I’m starting fresh, from the ground up and I’m doing it in public.</p>

<p>For now, I’m going way back. No style sheets. Purple and blue links. Just the bare essentials – two turntables and a microphone. You want responsive? You can’t get much better.</p>

<p>Over time I want this site to evolve into something I’m proud of, but it’s going to take just that – time. The old page is being <a href="http://v9.chuise.com" title="2013 &mdash; March, 2015">archived here</a> for posterity. I really wish I had kept track of other versions of the site, but the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/*/http://chuise.com" title="The complete history of this site.">Wayback Machine</a> apparently has that taken care of. Honestly, you’re not missing out on much. Hopefully this marks the end of an era for the “splash page” version of this site.</p>

<p>I don’t expect the site to stay like this for long. I’m sure a simple coat of paint will follow pretty fast. It’s pretty ugly around here right now, but that’s the point.</p>

<p>As designers I feel like our personal sites are often the cobbler’s children. There’s work to be done – whether it be our day jobs or side projects. Our energies are devoted to things we build for other people. We rarely get a chance to spend time on ourselves, unless we’re out looking for a job and trying to boost our portfolios.</p>

<p>This site has been the bastard child of a weary cobbler for far too long, it’s time it got a new pair of shoes – even if they are a shitty pair of Zips.</p>

<h3 id="update">Update</h3>
<p>I’ve started to clean things up since this post. The original version of the site <a href="http://v10.chuise.com" title="Version 10 &mdash; Annihilus">has been archived</a> as will all future versions.</p>

    	<p>June 18, 2014</p>

		<p>A few years ago we decided that our kitchen was pretty boring, very outdated, and badly in need of a paint job.</p>

<p>After painting most of the kitchen I had reached the spot that our refrigerator covers. I pulled the fridge away from the wall and I was shocked by what I saw. The house had come with an old refrigerator that probably hadn’t been moved in years, and I wasn’t around when the the new one had been installed —- so this was the first time I had actually seen the area in back of the fridge. In some places paint was cracking off the wall. In others the plaster had been broken off to run some electrical wire, but never patched up, exposing large chunks of wooden lathe behind the wall. Saying that it was a mess would be an understatement.</p>

<p>I painted the area that would be exposed around the fridge, but now I had a choice to make. What to do about this spot behind the fridge that lurked in the dark recesses of my kitchen? I could have easily packed up my gear and called it a night like so many obviously had. If I did, who would know? How many times would people actually look behind my refrigerator when the come to my house? What difference would it make to the rest of the room?</p>

<p>Instead of stopping I kept on painting. If only for my own satisfaction. Making sure that it was done correctly was important to me. Making it right, even if no one would see the work I had put into it.</p>

<p>The details that no one will ever see are often the ones that make the things we create successful. One of these days someone is going to pull the fridge away from the wall. Will they like what they see?</p>
