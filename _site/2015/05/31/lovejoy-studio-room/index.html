    	<p>For 10 years Mark was a teacher in the Philadelphia school district. After meeting his soon-to-be wife they relocated back to her hometown of Portland, OR to start their life together. Shortly after moving back they started to put in motion the idea of running a small art studio where Mark could teach drawing, painting, and printmaking. In addition to the art studio the couple had plans on creating a boutique Airbnb suite to entertain tourists traveling to Portland. The couple wanted the studio and guest suite to share the same name and decided to call their new venture Lovejoy.</p>

<p>With a name in place Lovejoy was looking to establish a modern, flexible brand identity that could be used to identify their two properties — Lovejoy Studio and Lovejoy Room.</p>

<p>After some exploration I wasn’t really happy with the direction I was taking. None of the options — just a few in the image above — seemed to meet the criteria of being modern and flexible. Simple marks weren’t distinctive enough and script-style logos didn’t seem to set the right tone.</p>

<p><img src="/images/projects/lovejoy/lovejoy-logos.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>I started toying around with the idea of combining the “L” and the “J” in Lovejoy. After a few iterations a simple, but elegant solution revealed itself. Combining the “L” and the “J” in the box-like shape seen above provided a simple, modern mark with some room for secondary treatment.</p>

<p>The mark also allows for some other creative applications, like using it as a viewfinder to focus on elements in a photo.</p>

<p>For the website the team from Lovejoy needed a simple site that could display upcoming course information and allow prospective students to register — in addition to location and contact information.</p>

<p>The result was a one-page website that focused on displaying course information in an easy-to-read format. The site is fully responsive and provides a pleasurable viewing experience on both desktop and mobile devices.</p>

<p>The project was rounded out with a branding package that included business cards and postcards.</p>
