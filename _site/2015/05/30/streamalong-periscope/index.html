    	<p>I like Periscope a lot. I’m not going to go into the reasons why here. I’ve already covered that <a href="/2015/04/16/streamalong/">in a separate post</a>. One my biggest gripes with Periscope is the ability to discover interesting content to watch. It turns out that I wasn’t alone. <a href="http://www.chrisbaglieri.com">Chris Baglieri</a> and I set out on a mission to create the TV Guide for streaming video. With that, <a href="http://streamalong.tv">Streamalong.tv</a> was born.</p>

<p><img src="/images/projects/streamalong/streamalong-logo-concepts.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Our goal was to launch something fast. That didn’t leave a whole lot of room for exploration on a logo. I tried a few things, but ultimately landed on a design that I had origianlly scribbled on a piece of paper earlier in the day. I knew that I wanted to form an “S” shape out of two objects to create the idea of “togetherness”, which is at the core of the name. Choosing the primary color was a bit easier. I don’t get a whole lot of opportunities to work with the color pink and decided now was the time.</p>

<p><img src="/images/projects/streamalong/streamalong-full-logo.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>The core idea behind Streamalong is organizing Periscope streams into easy to identify channels. The icons each follow similar pattern – simple illustrations, vibrant pallete, and a portion of the icon that extends outside of the bounding cirlce when it makes sense. The result was a fun, unique set of icons that helps give Streamalong some personality. The current fan favorite is the “Bored” channel icon.</p>

<p>We wanted to ensure that people browsing Streamalong on desktop and mobile devices had a similar experience. The site is fully responsive and utilizes some server-side components to help reduce the amount of information delivered to mobile devices to make sure that the pages load fast.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>While there are other discovery sites out there for Periscope and Meerkat like Lookats and Meerkat Streams, Streamalong is the most coherent and easy to navigate.

<p>We built Streamalong using Rails 4. Chris handled the heavy-lifting on the backend of the site while I handled the branding, illustration, HTML and Sass – with a little help from <a href="http://bourbon.io">Bourbon</a> and <a href="http://neat.bourbon.io">Neat</a>… and maybe a little bit of actual bourbon.</p>

<p>Streamalong was a fun project that was delivered very quickly. Streamalong was conceived, designed, developed, and launched in less than two weeks. It was featured on <a href="http://producthunt.com">ProductHunt</a> and ended the day as one of the top Hunts. In addtion to that, Streamalong was featured in <a href="http://thenextweb.com/apps/2015/04/17/streamalong-helps-you-discover-the-best-and-worst-of-periscope/">The Next Web</a> and <a href="http://technical.ly/philly/2015/04/17/streamalong-periscope-discovery-guide/">Technical.ly Philly</a>.</p>
