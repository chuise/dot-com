    <h1>Self-Destruct Sequence Initiated</h1>
    <p>March 18, 2015</p>
  </header>
  <p>For the longest time this website has been a picture of my face, as handsome as it is, and a few links to some places around the web where I post things. Not very interesting. At least not to me. I’ve always wanted it to be so much more. Way back in the day I tried an experiment where I would challenge myself to take a photo or draw something and pair it with some bit of text once a day. It forced me to stretch a bit. Sun salutations for creativity, perhaps.</p>

<p>But these days… who has the time?</p>

<p>I’m a father of two, and husband to one on the home-front. I’m also a design team of one at <a href="http://useartisan.com" title="This is where I work.">Artisan</a>. Throw in a passion project or two and an energetic dog for good measure. I’m spent. I want to dedicate time to building out a “personal brand” because everyone says it’s a good thing, but it’s probably better to invest that time, plus more, into being a better father and husband. I spend a lot of my time with my face buried <em>in</em> a device when I should be more concerned about what’s happening <em>around</em> them.</p>

<p>That being said, I do want this site to be <em>something</em>. I like to build. I like to experiment. I have opinions that I like to express. I have things that I want to share with whoever is paying attention. I want this to be the place where I do that.</p>

<p>My friend Kyle recently published an article about <a href="http://kylefiedler.com/2015/02/22/launching-incomplete.html" title="Read: Launch When You Aren't Ready by Kyle Fielder">launching before you’re ready</a>. I’m not ready. I don’t have a plan. There are no fonts picked out, no colors decided on, no epic design waiting in the wings. I’m starting fresh, from the ground up and I’m doing it in public.</p>

<p>For now, I’m going way back. No style sheets. Purple and blue links. Just the bare essentials – two turntables and a microphone. You want responsive? You can’t get much better.</p>

<p>Over time I want this site to evolve into something I’m proud of, but it’s going to take just that – time. The old page is being <a href="http://v9.chuise.com" title="2013 &mdash; March, 2015">archived here</a> for posterity. I really wish I had kept track of other versions of the site, but the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/*/http://chuise.com" title="The complete history of this site.">Wayback Machine</a> apparently has that taken care of. Honestly, you’re not missing out on much. Hopefully this marks the end of an era for the “splash page” version of this site.</p>

<p>I don’t expect the site to stay like this for long. I’m sure a simple coat of paint will follow pretty fast. It’s pretty ugly around here right now, but that’s the point.</p>

<p>As designers I feel like our personal sites are often the cobbler’s children. There’s work to be done – whether it be our day jobs or side projects. Our energies are devoted to things we build for other people. We rarely get a chance to spend time on ourselves, unless we’re out looking for a job and trying to boost our portfolios.</p>

<p>This site has been the bastard child of a weary cobbler for far too long, it’s time it got a new pair of shoes – even if they are a shitty pair of Zips.</p>

<h3 id="update">Update</h3>
<p>I’ve started to clean things up since this post. The original version of the site <a href="http://v10.chuise.com" title="Version 10 &mdash; Annihilus">has been archived</a> as will all future versions.</p>
