	<h3>About Me</h3>

Great! Me, too. I'm <a href="http://twitter.com/chuise" title="Follow me on Twitter.">@chuise</a>. If you would like to chat, <a href="mailto:hello@chuise.com" title="Drop me a line.">drop me a line</a>. You can also find some of my work on <a href="http://dribbble.com/chuise" title="View my Dribbble profile.">Dribbble</a>.</p>
